# Decimal to Binary - Easy

You are tasked with writing a Solidity contract that takes any unsigned integer (ranging from 0 to 255) as input, converts it to an 8-bit binary representation, and returns the binary representation as a string.

Example : Binary representation of 5 : "101", 8 bit representation : "00000101".

The contract should have the following features:

## Input

**toBinary(uint n) returns (string)**: This function takes unsigned integer as input and converts the input number to its 8-bit binary representation, and return the binary representation as a string.

### Examples

|    Example   |    Function    |           Parameter          |  Returns  |
| ----------   |  ------------  |          -----------         | --------- |
|      1       |   toBinary()   |              10              |   "00001010"  |  
|      2       |   toBinary()   |              25              |   "00011001"  |
